## Installing

```bash
npm install --save headbreaker

# optional: manually add konva to your project if you want to use
# it as rendering backend
npm install --save konva
```

## TL;DR sample

If you just want to see a very basic 2×2 puzzle in your web browser, create an HTML file with the following contents:

```html
<script src="https://flbulgarelli.github.io/headbreaker/js/headbreaker.js"></script>
<body>
  <div id="puzzle"></div>
  <script>
    const autogen = new headbreaker.Canvas('puzzle', {
      width: 800, height: 650,
      pieceSize: 100, proximity: 20,
      borderFill: 10, strokeWidth: 2, lineSoftness: 0.18,
    });
    autogen.autogenerate({
      horizontalPiecesCount: 2,
      verticalPiecesCount: 2,
      metadata: [
        {color: '#B83361'},
        {color: '#B87D32'},
        {color: '#A4C234'},
        {color: '#37AB8C'}
      ]
    });
    autogen.draw();
  </script>
</body>
```

And voilà! 🎊

## How it works

`headbreaker` — a Spanish pun for _rompecabezas_ — solves two different but related problems:

- It implements a **jigsaw-like data structure**, which can be used for modelling, traversing, importing/exporting and rendering. This data structure is 100% pure TypeScript with no dependencies, and works in both browsers and headless environments.
- It implements a simple and generic **rendering system** for the Web. `headbreaker` ships a fully functional [Konva.js](https://konvajs.org/)-based implementation, but you can develop and use your own.

### HTML Puzzle

```html
<!-- just add a div with an id... -->
<div id="my-canvas">
</div>

<script>
  // ...and a script with the following code:
  let dali = new Image();
  dali.src = 'static/dali.jpg';
  dali.onload = () => {
    const canvas = new headbreaker.Canvas('my-canvas', {
      width: 800, height: 800, image: dali
    });
    canvas.autogenerate();
    canvas.shuffle(0.7);
    canvas.draw();
  }
</script>
```

`Canvas` is a visual representation of a `Puzzle` and as such, it mirrors many of the most common `Puzzle` methods. If you need to access the associated `Puzzle` object, call the `puzzle` accessor:

```javascript
// create and configure the canvas
const canvas = new headbreaker.Canvas(...);
// ...

// now you can access and interact with the puzzle object
const puzzle = canvas.puzzle;
```
